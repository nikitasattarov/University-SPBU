\begin{letter}{Mr. Galin Jones \\ University of Minnesota \\ 100 Church St SE \\ Minneapolis MN 55455 \\ USA}
\opening{Dear Professor Jones,}
I am pleased to express my desire to you to get a Master's degree in Statistics at the The University of Minnesota.

I have read your Handbook of Markov Chain Monte Carlo and read your most cited articles. Your work inspired me to study Markov chains Monte Carlo in more depth
and I have a strong desire to study it under your guidance.

At the moment, I am studying in the third year in Applied Mathematics and Informatics at the Saint Petersburg State University. For a long time I have been interested in mathematics and statistics, specifically in building mathematical models based on real data and analyzing them. I think the knowledge that I will gain by studying in the direction you represent will help me develop in the field of my scientific interests successfully.

If you have any questions, please let me know.
\closing{Yours faithfully,}
\end{letter}
